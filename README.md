# BookChain

**IN DEVELOPMENT**
BookChain is a decentralized textbook exchange platform, using smart contracts to offer a trustworthy peer-to-peer exchange system.

This codebase uses the Truffle Ethereum Development Framework

1. Use "truffle develop" to launch development ethereum client and the console
2. Compile smart contracts with "truffle compile"
3. Deploy smart contracts onto the development ethereum blockchain with "truffle migrate"
4. Interact with the smart contract from the console (e.g. var book = Textbook.at(Textbook.address) , book.addBook('IBSN Code'))
